# 100 Composing Methods

Much of refactoring is devoted to correctly composing methods. In most cases, excessively long methods are the root of all evil. The vagaries of code inside these methods conceal the execution logic and make the method extremely hard to understandâ€”and even harder to change.

The refactoring techniques in this group streamline methods, remove code duplication, and pave the way for future improvements.
