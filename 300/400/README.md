# 400 Dispensables
A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.

## 100 Comments

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

A method is filled with explanatory comments.

## 200 Duplicate Code

See [README.md](./200/README.md)

Two code fragments look almost identical.

## 300 Lazy Class

See [README.md](./300/README.md)

Understanding and maintaining classes always costs time and money. So if a class doesn’t do enough to earn your attention, it should be deleted.

## 400 Data Class

See [README.md](./400/README.md)

A data class refers to a class that contains only fields and crude methods for accessing them (getters and setters). These are simply containers for data used by other classes. These classes don’t contain any additional functionality and can’t independently operate on the data that they own.

## 500 Dead Code

See [README.md](./500/README.md)

A variable, parameter, field, method or class is no longer used (usually because it’s obsolete).

## 600 Speculative Generality

See [README.md](./600/README.md)

There’s an unused class, method, field or parameter.
